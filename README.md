<h2 align="center">academic research</h2>
<p align="center">I spent part of my time at university focusing on image processing and 3D game development using unity. I developed a <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1zGm144yiDmq8R3pE5ZqZf66XYSpd-p5H/view">VR game to assist in the treatment of patients with acrophobia</a> and an <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QYsnVK3YidNpRjbK_nuc9Jac0MnW1dv1/view">AR application for the treatment of patients with arachnophobia,</a> both focused on research projects and with published papers. I also made an application using raspberry pi 3 that <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/12srGHvZRDcTmyLTJmXtsIU6OnC0uFBTq/edit">analyzes dry coffee beans and selects good and bad beans</a>. The application uses python to process the colors of the grain and would be integrated into a machine and would control a stepper motor that would sort the grain, but the project was discontinued.</p>

<h2 align="center"> I’m currently learning </h2>
